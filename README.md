# [Open FUN Blog](https://openfun.github.io/blog)

[![Deployed](https://github.com/openfun/blog/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openfun/blog/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml)

The technical blog of [Open FUN](https://github.com/openfun) powered by
[Hugo](https://github.com/https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the
[blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) theme.

## Getting started

If this is the first time you use this repository you must run the following command:

```sh
make bootstrap
```

Next time you can simply use the command:

```sh
make run
```

to start the Hugo development server.

Once this is done, Hugo is served on http://localhost:1313 ðŸŽ‰.

You are now able to write content! Take a look at the [next section](#authoring) to know how to do.

## Authoring

### Create a new post

To create a new post, run the command :

```sh
make post
```

Then fill the prompt by providing the post title :

```sh
What is the title of the new post?
>>>
```

Once the post created, post content is stored into `/content/posts/<your-new-post>/` directory.

#### Thumbnail

Post images must be located into the same folder than the post itself. To use an image as thumbnail,
it must be prefixed by `feature-`.

### Add a new author

Author descriptions are located into `data/authors` and author images are located into
`assets/authors`.

```sh
cd data/authors
cp template.json <author_name>.json
```

Then fill all fields with your personal information.

#### Attach an author to a post

Within the post header, you can add an `authors` attributes. The author name corresponds to the name
of the file you created previously.

e.g:

```md
title: "Post title" ... authors:

- "<author_name>"

---
```
