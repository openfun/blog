Activities are a backbone of the xAPI specification and of learning systems across the universe üí´.
The spec defines different ways of describing them giving them the power to travel through space and
time !

In this blog post we‚Äôll shed some light on this fascinating process and discuss the terms of
**activity**, **activity definition**, **activity metadata**, and (for the bravest) the final boss
üëæ : **canonical activity definition**.

As a bonus, when you'll finish reading this blog post you'll be able to fully understand the
following xAPI diagram summarizing interactions between different activities source ! üòé

## Some context üìñ

### The experience API

We suppose the reader is familiar with the existence of the
[Experience API (xAPI)](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec) and to some extent to the concept of
[xAPI statement](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-statement).

The Experience API (xAPI) is the internation standard for learning data.  
In their own words it's _a technical specification that aims to facilitate the documentation and
communication of learning experiences._

It is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec).

### Post perimeter üöß

We're going to discuss the concepts behind the xAPI representation of activities and what it means
to
[Learning Record Producers](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-learning-record-provider)
(LRP, like [marsha](https://github.com/openfun/marsha)),
[Learning Record Stores](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-learning-record-store)
(LRS, like [ralph](https://github.com/openfun/ralph)) and
[Learning Record Consumers](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-learning-record-consumer)
(LRC, like [warren](https://github.com/openfun/warren)) We'll try to make the concept of activity
clearer for all parties so that anyone can make enlightened decisions about how to share or query
activity definitions and metadata !

### Post summary

The term 'activity' appears in different sections of the specification and the different concepts
introduced by the spec are somewhat intertwined with one another. To make the following explanations
easier to grasp, we'll present them step by step according to the masterful plan below :

- What the hell is an activity according to the spec ?
- How is an activity modeled ? That is, what is its structure ?
- Where can we find an activity's definition or additional metadata ? üõí
- How do the different activity definitions source interact with each other to produce the very
  tasty activity cake üßÅ ? (not specified by the spec but don't forget to add sugar üòä)

## The xAPI activity ‚öΩ

Let's start with a philosophical question: what exactly is life ? ... Sorry I meant, what exactly is
an activity ?

According to the spec, an activity is
[_a type of Object making up the "this" in "I did this"_](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-activity).
_In the Statement "Anna tried a cake recipe üéÇ", the recipe constitutes the Activity in terms of the
xAPI Statement._

From a learning record producer (LRP) point of view, activities will often solely exist in xAPI
statements ; statements being the only way to transmit activities to a Learning Record Store (LRS).
We'll see that from an LRS or LRC point of view, things can get more involved.

## The activity recipe ü•Æ

An activity is **always** expressed following the structure of an
[**activity definition**](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#activity-definition)

The activity definition must not be confused with the concept of activity
[metadata](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#30-metadata) even though
both terms are overlapping. The spec does not express this difference precisely but here it is in
plain, technical and boring english :

- an activity definition describes the **structure** of an activity. The activity definition is
  mentioned in the spec in the detail when
  [describing the statement structure](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#activity-definition)
- activity [metadata](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#30-metadata) is a
  term that indicates that activity metadata is hosted by an external source **but must also follow
  the activity definition structure**. In the last part we'll see that the LRS must maintain an
  internal canonical activity definition üëæ where it MAY merge different sources of activity
  definition (from multiple statements and/or a metadata provider)

üîé TLDR : activity metadata is expressed as an activity definition but the term indicates a third
party provenance (as opposed to xAPI statements and / or the LRS canonical activity
definition -[see below](#canonical-activity-definition-))

üîé NB : it is also possible to store **unstructured** data about an activity, and we'll see about
this
[below](#in-the-activity-profile-resourcehttpsgithubcomadlnetxapi-specblobmasterxapi-communicationmdactprofres).

## Shopping for activities üõí

### Activity definitions

Activity definitions are found in multiple places and can be merged in different ways according both
to the spec and the LRS implementation. We can find them :

#### In xAPI statements

This is the most common place for activity definition.  
Activity definitions are found in two places inside a statement :

**üìå In the `object` property**

Only
[when the ObjectType is an Activity](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#2441-when-the-objecttype-is-activity),
(actually the most common case with statements) the activity definition is found in the `definition`
property of the `object`. This means `statement.object.definition` is an activity definition (big up
if you deducted that yourself ! üòâ).

**üìå In the `context` property**

The statement optional `context` can have a `contextActivities` property that is
[_A map of the types of learning activity context that this Statement is related to. Valid context types are: "parent", "grouping", "category" and "other"_](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#2462-contextactivities-property:~:text=A%20map%20of%20the%20types%20of%20learning%20activity%20context%20that%20this%20Statement%20is%20related%20to.%20Valid%20context%20types%20are%3A%20parent%2C%20%22grouping%22%2C%20%22category%22%20and%20%22other%22)

According to the spec : _Many Statements do not just involve one (Object) Activity that is the
focus, but relate to other contextually relevant Activities. The "contextActivities" property allows
for these related Activities to be represented in a structured manner._

Statements matching these activities can be queries via a GET on `/xAPI/statements` by setting the
query parameter
[`related_activities`](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#:~:text=Apply%20the%20Activity,the%20%22activity%22%20parameter.)
to True. The response will _include statements for which the Object, any of the context Activities,
or any of those properties in a contained SubStatement match the Activity parameter._

That was a mouthful, let's digest it with a strong double espresso ‚òï before we follow on.

### [Activities resource](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#22-document-resources:~:text=The%20Activities%20Resource%20provides%20a%20method%20to%20retrieve%20a%20full%20description%20of%20an%20Activity%20from%20the%20LRS)

As well as the statements resource the xAPI spec defines other
[resources](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#20-resources)
including the activities resource. _The Activities Resource provides a method to retrieve a full
description of an Activity from the LRS._

The request will return the **canonical activity definition** üëæ of the LRS. We'll explain this
concept [below](#canonical-activity-definition-).

### [Metadata providers](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#30-metadata)

The activity id, an IRI, can optionally resolve to an URL hosted by an external service (like an
LMS) that defines an **authoritative metadata** (scary too ! [see below](#authoritative-metadata-)).
The activity metadata should be structured according to the
[activity definition](#the-activity-recipe-)

### Unstructured activity data

Because the structure of the activity definition can feel a bit tight around the shoulders, the xAPI
spec make it possible to store activity metadata with total freedom in two places.

#### 1. In the activity definition

- The `moreinfo` property _resolves to a document with human-readable information about the
  Activity, which could include a way to launch the activity. It could be hosted by the LRS or by a
  third party._
- The [`extensions`](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#41-extensions)
  property allows activity properties to be extended and exploited by a single application or a
  Community of Practice.

#### 2. In the [activity profile resource](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#actprofres)

This resource is a
[document resource](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#22-document-resources)
and allows Learning Record Providers (LRP) to save arbitrary data in the form of documents. It is
the ultimate scratchpad for activities. Put everything you want there (including cakes üç∞) !

## The activity's canon üí£

Now we've reviewed every single place an activity can be described let's put the last nail in the
coffee and explain how these different sources can ... make the activity definition evolve with time
ü™Ñ !

You read that right ! Even though xAPI statements are
[**immutable**](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#statement-immutability-and-exceptions),
two xAPI concepts make it possible to update an activity definition and backport (or not) this
changes into existing xAPI statements.

You knew this moment would come ... yeah it's time to confront two monsters of the xAPI
specification ..!  
Prepare your poke bowl and let me unleash in the arena ... :

- the **canonical activity definition** üëæ as well as its little brother
- the **authoritative metadata** üêô !

Let's clarify these two terms and finally understand the way an activity definition can evolve with
time.

### Canonical activity definition üëæ

In addition to store statements an LRS is supposed to separately maintain a **canonical activity
definition** for each new activity. The idea behind this is twofold :

- allow Learning Record Consumers to query the canonical activity definition by using the
  [Activities Resource endpoint](#activities-resourcehttpsgithubcomadlnetxapi-specblobmasterxapi-communicationmd22-document-resourcestextthe20activities20resource20provides20a20method20to20retrieve20a20full20description20of20an20activity20from20the20lrs)
- allow the LRS to return an up-to-date activity definition in
  [previous statements](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#statement-immutability-and-exceptions:~:text=Activity%20Definitions%20referenced%20by%20a%20Statement.%20The%20content%20of%20Activity%20Definitions%20that%20are%20referenced%20in%20Statements%20is%20not%20considered%20part%20of%20the%20Statement%20itself)
  (using the `canonical` parameter of `/xAPI/statements` or by default)

This **canonical activity definition** may be updated by incorporating the activity definition
expressed in more recent
[statements](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#lrs-requirements-1).

It may also incorporate the definition hosted by a **metadata provider**

The LRS is free to pick which definition to choose !

### Authoritative metadata üêô

A
[metadata provider](#metadata-providershttpsgithubcomadlnetxapi-specblobmasterxapi-datamd30-metadata),
can host activity metadata. This metadata is considered by the spec as **authoritative metadata**
and serves two purposes :

- allow a third party (like a Learning Record Consumer) to look it up to get the most recent version
  of the activity definition
- be exploited by an LRS when it acts as a
  [metadata consumer](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-About.md#def-metadata-consumer)
  and
  [_incorporate the loaded definition into its canonical definition for that Activity, while preserving names or definitions not included in the loaded definition_](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md#lrs-requirements-5)

Another mouthful ! üòÜ

## Conclusion

Congrats to the brave readers that followed along this somewhat arduous subject üéâ ! They can now
understand fully the introduction diagram ‚úåÔ∏è

In this post we've learnt about :

- activities : what they are and how are they specified
- who uses them and how they can be queried
- What the hell is a canonical activity definition and why it matters

Cheers and let's hope we'll meet again to explore together the magical world of xAPI and digital
learning ! üëã
